# turtledrawspongebob
# I originally planned on using TurtleDraw to help draw SpongeBob with a text file. 
# I did infact have the program run and draw SpongeBob with a text file.
# If I had more time, I would definetly add color to SpongeBob (i only added color to fill in his eyes and the background).
# Feel free to add on and enhance this turtledraw. Contact me: josebustamante@lewisu.edu
